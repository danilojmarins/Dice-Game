# Dice Game

## This project is a simple Dice Game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project was proposed during the DOM module of the course: "[The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)".

How it works: Every time the page is refreshed, the dices are given a random number, and the one with the greatest number wins the round.

The mainly purpose behind this project is to learn how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) with JavaScript.
